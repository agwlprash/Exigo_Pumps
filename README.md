# Cellix-Pump-code-glass-syringe
This script allows the Cellix pump to be run by your computer without the Ipad that comes with it. The script includes some strings with serial code for the pump, change them only if you are sure of the changes (check the manual for the serial communications of the [pump](https://www.wearecellix.com/exigopump)). This script is set to run with a glass syringe.
